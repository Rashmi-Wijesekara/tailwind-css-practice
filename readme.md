# Tailwind CSS Practice

This was covered in the `Tailwind CSS From Scratch _ Learn By Building Projects` Udemy course.

The sandbox contains around 20 different folders/files that focus on specific aspects/classes of Tailwind.

The **"tailwind-sandbox-done"** folder is obviously the finished code.

This have used the Play CDN.
